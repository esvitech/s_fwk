\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
defines a timer. 

\-This timer is used to call a callbach functon in a specific time.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item time\-\_\-w is the time on which the callback is called.
\item the callback handler which is called the this fd receives an event.
\item the user data which will be included in the callback.
\item the variable stop is used to stop the timer.
\item the last variable is the id of the timer.
