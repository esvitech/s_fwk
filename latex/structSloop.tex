define a simple element of \hyperlink{structSloop}{\-Sloop}.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$sloop.\-h$>$}



\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
define a simple element of \hyperlink{structSloop}{\-Sloop}. 

\hyperlink{structSloop}{\-Sloop} is used to define a simple element os the loop which contains the following informations \-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the file descriptor of the element.
\item the callback handler which is called the this fd receives an event.
\item the user data which will be included in the callback.
\item 
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\hyperlink{sloop_8h}{sloop.\-h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
